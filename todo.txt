- Two-person integrity policy type
  * Insititutional entity type (an account for hudson shouldn't have the
    authority to sign-off on a request that requires two-person integrity -- two
    non-institutional accounts must sign off on it)
- Improved URL dispatching for management requests like time-lock cancellation
  or two-person integrity request authorization.
- Update and RST-ify documentation
- Don't wait until request timeout to check TimeLock. Check periodically and
  fail early if a TimeLock'd request is cancelled.
- Store credentials using kvstore.
- Sign AWS requests in AWSProxy, get rid of Authorizer.prepare().
- Allow per-policy proxy configuration.
- Make FileAuditTrail thread-safe.
- Add UUID to Request so it can be used as a correlation identifier in logging
  and so policy implementations don't have to generate a UUID themselves..?
